# RimWorld Modding Resources

## Updating to 0.19/1.0
- [Tynan's forum post for 0.19](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=41766.0)
- [Python script to convert graphic_multi texture files to the correct extension](https://gist.github.com/spdskatr/d0cb17db9dfe23f58d8bbbeda1795845) (from \_back to \_north, \_side to \_east, and \_front to \_south)

## Getting set up

- [Picking a text editor](texteditor) - Whichever you use, use the find in files option.
- **Recommended decompilers:**
  - [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/releases) - feature-rich and often updated.
    - dnSpy can be used to debug Unity games that you can't usually debug. Read [here](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/wiki/Debugging-Unity-Games), remember to download the Unity-debugging-win32.zip from releases
  - [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy#ilspy-------) - fast and simple.
      - The official release has now surpassed Zhentar's old fork previously favoured by the community.
  - [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/download/) - primarily useful when transpiling because of its synchronised IL and C# view.
- [Setting up a solution for RimWorld](http://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Setting_up_a_solution) or [setting up Visual Studio](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-get-started-with-visual-studio). You'll need to be able to target the .NET 3.5 framework to mod RimWorld.
- [fyarn's Rimworld Mod Development Cookiecutter](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=39038): Set up a fully functional mod development environment in 30 seconds or less with a Visual Studio integration
- [Things you might not know](nobodyreadsthereadme)

## XML
