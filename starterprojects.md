# Starter projects

If you're looking for a new C# project but don't know where to start, here are some ideas. As there are more than enough things to learn when you start out, ideas here are small and utilitarian. The philosophy behind them is that mods here can be considered "afternoon projects", as a sort of overly optimistic estimate of the time requirement. This isn't taking into account Hofstadter's law.

>Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
